Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a rare, aggressive subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with developmental origins in early childhood. To uncover long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) sustaining this high-risk malignancy, we conducted CRISPR interference screens targeting lncRNAs overexpressed in primary AMKL samples. This analysis identified SNHG29 as a previously unrecognized lineage-specific dependency, whose silencing pro-foundly impaired leukemic proliferation and clonogenic growth in vitro …

Radiotherapy (RT) transforms tumour tissues into in situ vaccines that trigger antitumor immunity. Immunogenicity depends on how RT is delivered, since heterogeneous RT (spatially fractionated RT, SFRT) elicits more prominent responses than the conventional homogenous one. However, this phenomenon cannot be clinically harnessed, unless the relevant pathways are identified. To gain insights, we developed a hybrid dry-lab/wet-lab approach that integrates systems-level immune phenotypes established…

Acquired resistance to osimertinib remains a major challenge in treating EGFR-mutant (EGFR+) Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Although most patients initially respond to treatment, relapses are universal, even after prolonged remission during which tumor dormancy occurs. Here, we show that osimertinib induces and maintains senescence in EGFR+ NSCLC. Importantly, osimertinib does not kill senescent cells; however, following drug withdrawal, cells escape and resume proliferation. To examine the…
