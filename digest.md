In most cancers, intratumoral plasma cells prognose better patient survival and response to immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs), but their importance to ICB therapy response has never been tested. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are deadly sarcomas that lack effective therapies. Recent work in de novo MPNSTs showed dual inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6) and MEK increases intratumoral plasma cells and sensitizes tumors to anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) t…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Cancer is generally thought to be caused by expansion of a single mutant cell. However, analyses of human early lesions show that tumours can originate from several genetically distinct cell populations. How neighbouring mutant clones interact to shape tumourigenesis, and which driver genes mediate these effects is largely unexplored. Here, we use an in vivo mosaic Drosophila epithelial model to systematically test interclonal interactions during early Ras-driven tumourigenesis. We screened 88 r…

Structural variants (SVs) contribute substantially to genomic variation and disease, but detecting somatic SVs (sSVs) remains difficult due to reference bias, mosaicism, and enrichment in repetitive regions. Linear reference genomes, like GRCh38 and CHM13, do not fully capture individual genomic structure, which can obscure true somatic variation. Donor-specific assemblies (DSAs) generated from the same genome where sSVs are being assayed provide a personalized alternative, yet their performance…

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is among the most aggressive cancers, with low rates of durable response to chemoradiotherapy and limited therapeutic options for relapsed disease. To uncover mechanisms of treatment resistance and relapse, we performed comprehensive multi-omics profiling of >100 pre-treatment and post-relapse ESCC tumors from a prospective clinical trial (NCT04694391), integrating whole-exome/genome sequencing, bulk RNA-sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and spatia…

Biological data is prone to both intrinsic and extrinsic noise and variability between experimental replicas. That same stochasticity and heterogeneity can carry information about underlying biochemical mechanisms but, if not incorporated in modeling and probabilistic inference, can also bias parameter estimates and misguide predictions and, subsequently, experiment design. Mechanistic inference typically requires lengthy simulations (e.g., the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA)); approximati…
