This phenomenon is distinct from classical posterior collapse driven by KL regularization. By augmenting training with binomial…

Background <p>Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 2 (TIPE2) is an intracellular immune checkpoint protein known to suppress T cell activation and effector function. Despite its role in limiting T cell responses, CAR-T cells are prone to TIPE2-mediated inhibitory signaling. We therefore hypothesized that inhibiting this immune checkpoint would enhance CAR-T cell anti-tumor function.</p> Methods <p>To overcome TIPE2-mediated negative regulation, we engineered a novel second-generation N…

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><div class="boxTitle">Motivation</div>Understanding temporal gene expression is fundamental in the study of cellular development and differentiation. In practice, temporal single-cell datasets tend to contain only a limited number of measured time points, which are often unevenly spaced, resulting in irregular intervals between observations due to experimental constraints. Existing methods typically address these intervals by seq…

Background <p>Bevacizumab is widely used for recurrent high-grade glioma, but the real-world effectiveness of bevacizumab with or without irinotecan remains uncertain. We evaluated outcomes of bevacizumab-based regimens in a large multicenter Turkish cohort.</p> Methods <p>In this retrospective study from 30 centers, adults with recurrent glioblastoma or other primary brain tumors treated with a bevacizumab-containing regimen at first or second progression were included. Patients received bevaci…
