## scoring block
Scoring calibration:
Score ≥ 0.85 ONLY if the item is clearly relevant to high-risk neuroblastoma / pediatric oncology
  and includes at least one of:
  - targeted therapy response/resistance (ALK, ATR, DDR, RTK/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, cell-cycle, apoptosis)
  - biomarker discovery/validation (predictive, prognostic, pharmacodynamic)
  - multi-omics integration (bulk RNA-seq, sc/snRNA-seq, proteomics, phosphoproteomics)
  - mechanistic or translational relevance (PDX/organoid/preclinical trial/clinical cohort)

Score 0.65–0.84 for methods papers with strong transfer value to my work:
  - single-cell methods, foundation models (scFMs), representation learning
  - network/regulatory inference (VIPER/msVIPER/GRN)
  - multi-omics integration, robust statistical modeling, reproducible workflows

Score 0.40–0.64 for general oncology, computational biology, or AI methods with indirect relevance.

Cap score at 0.25 if primarily unrelated domains (e.g., non-cancer biology with no transferable method).

## narrative
My research focuses on high-risk neuroblastoma and pediatric cancer, with an emphasis on mechanisms of response, relapse, and resistance to targeted therapies. I am particularly interested in translational questions around ALK- and ATR-directed strategies, including monotherapy and combination treatments, and in identifying biomarkers that can guide patient stratification and treatment decisions.

I work across multi-omics layers, including bulk RNA-seq, single-cell/single-nucleus transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics, using patient-derived and preclinical models (including PDX systems) as well as clinically relevant cohorts. A central goal is to connect molecular programs and cell states to drug sensitivity phenotypes and clinically meaningful outcomes.

Methodologically, I prioritize robust and interpretable computational approaches for biomarker discovery and mechanism inference: differential modeling, pathway-level analyses, network/regulatory inference (including master regulator frameworks), and multimodal integration. I am also actively tracking AI and machine learning advances for single-cell analysis, especially foundation-model style approaches (scFMs), representation learning, and methods that can improve interpretability, reproducibility, and translational utility.

I prioritize papers that provide:
1) actionable biological insight into pediatric oncology and neuroblastoma therapy resistance,
2) rigorous biomarker discovery/validation frameworks,
3) transferable computational methods for multi-omics and single-cell analysis,
4) clear translational bridges from model systems to clinical application.

I am less interested in purely descriptive studies without mechanistic or translational framing, and in methods papers that do not demonstrate practical utility for biomarker or therapy-response questions.

Some paper themes I want to track closely:
* Targeted therapy resistance mechanisms in neuroblastoma (especially ALK/ATR contexts)
* Biomarker discovery pipelines for pediatric cancers (predictive/prognostic/pharmacodynamic)
* Cell-state plasticity (e.g., adrenergic–mesenchymal dynamics) under treatment pressure
* Integrative analyses linking transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome to drug response
* Network-based and master-regulator approaches for mechanism and target prioritization
* AI for single-cell: foundation models, transfer learning, and clinically useful representations
* Reproducible computational frameworks for translational multi-omics oncology
